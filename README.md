### Features

- **Adaptive Learning**: The system learns and improves recommendations based on historical performance

### How It Works

1. The system uses a DQN (Deep Q-Network) architecture with experience replay
2. Features are extracted from real-time pool data (APR, TVL, volatility, etc.)
3. Recommendations are weighted based on:
   - 50% technical factors (APR, TVL, volume)
   - 25% prediction scores from SolPool Insight API
   - 25% sentiment data from FilotSense API
4. Users provide feedback on investments, which trains the model further
