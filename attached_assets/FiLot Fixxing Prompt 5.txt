FiLot now executes real Solana transactions via WalletConnect and Raydium LP deposits.

The transaction flow, wallet integration, and database logging are complete.

To finalize this as a production-ready DeFi bot, please:

---

### WHAT TO IMPROVE:

#### 1. Add **slippage tolerance** to `build_raydium_lp_transaction()`:
- Support a default slippage of 0.5% (50 basis points)
- Add optional `min_lp_tokens` param
- Show slippage value in confirmation UI

#### 2. Add **pre-checks** in `execute_investment()`:
- Ensure:
  - Wallet is connected
  - User has sufficient token A & B balances
  - Pool is active
  - Transaction won’t exceed size/RPC limits

#### 3. Enhance Telegram **confirmation screen** before investing:
- In `handle_confirm_smart_investment()`:
  - Show user:
    - Token A/B split in real units
    - Pool name, APR
    - Estimated LP tokens
    - Slippage applied

#### 4. Improve **error handling**:
- If user cancels in wallet, mark `InvestmentLog` as `"failed"` and note `"user rejected"`
- If Solana RPC errors, include `"RPC error"` in notes
- Add `try/except` block around `submit_signed_transaction()`

### OUTPUT

Return:
- Updated `wallet_actions.py` with these improvements
- Improved confirmation UI in `button_responses.py` or `smart_invest.py`
- Changes to `models.py` if logging slippage or LP token estimates
- Any added helper methods for slippage, price checks, or balance validation

This will complete FiLot’s transformation into a production-grade, agentic DeFi Telegram bot.
