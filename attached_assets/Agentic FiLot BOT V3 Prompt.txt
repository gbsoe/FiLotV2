Develop a simplified, One-Command UX using buttons to trigger the /invest flow. The goal is to implement persistent buttons, inline actions, and ensure the bot is highly accessible, reducing the need for users to type commands.

SYSTEM CONTEXT
You are an AI assistant working on the FiLot Telegram Bot (Python 3.11+, python-telegram-bot, Flask backend, PostgreSQL) hosted on Replit. The bot currently has multiple slash commands (e.g. /invest, /explore, /account). We now want to simplify the user experience (UX) to a one-command flow for investment actions, accessible through buttons and natural language processing.


---

OBJECTIVE

Simplify bot UX with just three main commands: /invest, /explore, /account.

Implement a persistent reply keyboard with buttons that trigger investment actions.

When the user taps “💰 Invest”, it should initiate the entire investment process with a natural conversation flow: amount → profile → confirmation → execution.

Add inline buttons for quick access at any point in the conversation flow (e.g., to re-trigger the investment flow).

Remove the need for users to memorize slash commands or manually type them.

TASKS & DELIVERABLES

1. Add Persistent Reply Keyboard for Navigation

On /start and /help, the bot should send a message with the following reply keyboard:

“💰 Invest” → triggers the investment flow.

“🔍 Explore” → triggers /explore menu.

“👤 Account” → triggers /account menu.



Code Example:

from telegram import ReplyKeyboardMarkup

MAIN_KEYBOARD = ReplyKeyboardMarkup(
    [["💰 Invest"], ["🔍 Explore", "👤 Account"]],
    resize_keyboard=True,
    one_time_keyboard=False
)

@dp.message_handler(commands=['start', 'help'])
async def on_start(message):
    await message.reply(
        "Welcome to FiLot! Tap a button below to get started:",
        reply_markup=MAIN_KEYBOARD
    )


2. Implement /invest Flow with Slot-Filling

After the user taps “💰 Invest”, ask for the investment amount:

Bot: "How much would you like to invest?"

User: Responds with an amount (e.g., "100").


Ask the user to choose their profile:

Bot: "High-risk or stable?"

User: Responds with "High-risk" or "Stable".


Show the top 2 recommended pools based on the chosen profile, with inline buttons for confirmation:

Bot: "You can invest in Pool A with 20% APR or Pool B with 15% APR. Choose A or B."



Code Example:

@dp.message_handler(lambda message: message.text.lower() == "💰 invest")
async def on_invest(message: Message):
    # Ask for amount
    await message.reply("How much would you like to invest?")
    # Transition to waiting for amount input
    state = "awaiting_amount"


3. Inline Buttons for Quick Access

For any command or screen (e.g., after showing positions), always include an inline button to re-trigger the investment flow.

Inline Button Example: “💰 Invest” to restart the process.


Code Example:

from telegram import InlineKeyboardButton, InlineKeyboardMarkup

INVEST_INLINE = InlineKeyboardMarkup(
    [[InlineKeyboardButton("💰 Invest", callback_data="start_invest")]]
)

@dp.callback_query_handler(lambda c: c.data == "start_invest")
async def on_invest_button(cb):
    # Start investment flow again
    await on_invest(cb.message)


4. Natural Language Understanding for Flexible Inputs

Implement intent detection to recognize natural language investment-related queries:

User: “I want to invest 500 in high-risk” → automatically treated as /invest high-risk 500.

User: “How are my positions doing?” → bot responds with active positions.



Code Example:

@dp.message_handler(func=lambda message: 'invest' in message.text.lower())
async def on_invest_nlp(message: Message):
    amount = extract_amount(message.text)  # Implement amount extraction logic
    profile = detect_profile(message.text)  # Implement profile detection logic
    await on_invest_with_amount_and_profile(message, amount, profile)


5. Database Integration for Storing Positions and Context

Store each user's context (profile, amount, selected pool) in a session (Redis or in-memory).

Use the session data to show the last selected pool and ensure users can restart the flow from where they left off.


Code Example:

def store_user_context(user_id, context_data):
    # Store context data (profile, amount, pool)
    pass


6. Monitoring and Exit

Implement a Monitoring Agent that watches for potential impermanent loss (IL) or drop in APR.

If conditions indicate risk (e.g., APR dropping or sentiment declining), the bot should offer the user an Exit button to withdraw from the pool.


Code Example:

@dp.message_handler(func=lambda message: 'exit' in message.text.lower())
async def on_exit(message: Message):
    # Process to withdraw from the selected pool
    await message.reply("Exiting your investment.")


7. Testing & Documentation

Ensure that the following tests are written:

Slot-filling dialogue tests (amount, profile, confirmation).

Button handling tests for inline buttons.

Intent detection for natural language inputs.


Update README.md to reflect the new commands, workflows, and the “one-command” flow.

INSTRUCTIONS FOR REPLIT AI AGENT

Modify bot.py to implement the persistent keyboard with buttons for Invest, Explore, and Account.

Implement the on_invest flow with slot-filling and automatic fallback to button presses.

Add logic to trigger investment or show positions based on natural language input.

Ensure inline buttons are added throughout to restart the investment flow.

Store and retrieve user context, so they can pick up where they left off.

Create tests for each component (button handling, conversation flows, error handling).

Provide clear documentation on setting up, using, and testing the new flow.

End Result
This plan will turn your FiLot Telegram bot into a one-command UX, with users only needing to tap “💰 Invest” to initiate everything from amount input to execution. The bot will intelligently guide users through a frictionless experience, whether they type naturally or press buttons.
