FiLot is now able to connect Solana wallets and simulate investments.

Now, I need to replace the mock logic in `execute_investment()` with real Solana transaction logic so the bot can:

- Build a real Raydium LP deposit transaction
- Send the unsigned transaction to the user via WalletConnect v2
- Await and track signature
- Log result in the InvestmentLog model

---

### WHAT TO DO NEXT

#### 1. Use `solana-py` or `anchorpy` to construct a real transaction:
In `wallet_actions.py > execute_investment(...)`:
- Fetch pool metadata via `/pools/{id}` (from SolPool)
- Use `PublicKey`, `Transaction`, `TransactionInstruction` to:
  - Create associated token accounts (if needed)
  - Approve token transfer
  - Call Raydium program to deposit into LP
- Serialize the transaction for WalletConnect

#### 2. Integrate with WalletConnect v2:
- In `WalletConnectManager.send_transaction()`:
  - Encode the serialized transaction (base58 or base64)
  - Send it to the wallet for signing
  - Wait for the signed tx or rejection
  - Broadcast via RPC (`https://api.mainnet-beta.solana.com`)

#### 3. Log the transaction result:
- Save `tx_hash`, `status`, `pool_id`, `amount`, and timestamps to `InvestmentLog`

#### 4. Update `handle_confirm_smart_investment(...)`:
- Ensure wallet is connected
- Call `execute_investment(wallet_address, pool_id, amount)`
- Send user a confirmation (e.g. “Investment sent! View on Solscan: https://solscan.io/tx/abc123”)

#### 5. Add fallbacks:
- If wallet not connected → show “Please connect your wallet first”
- If signing rejected → show “Transaction cancelled”
- If RPC fails → show error and mark investment as failed

---

### OUTPUT

Return:
- Updated `wallet_actions.py` with real `execute_investment()` logic using `solana-py`
- Updates to `WalletConnectManager` with real transaction delivery
- Updated investment confirmation flow in `button_responses.py` or `smart_invest.py`
- Any added helper functions (e.g. get_pool_metadata, build_lp_tx)

This will make FiLot a fully agentic Telegram investment bot capable of suggesting and executing yield-farming investments with one tap.
