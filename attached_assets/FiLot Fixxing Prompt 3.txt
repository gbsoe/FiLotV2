Real Wallet Execution + Solana Integration
FiLot is now a fully functional Telegram investment assistant for Solana liquidity pools. The next goal is to go from investment simulation to real transaction execution.

The current setup includes:
- Wallet connection (mocked, via `/walletconnect`)
- `execute_investment(wallet_address, pool_id, amount)` stub function in `wallet_actions.py`
- Smart Invest logic that recommends pools and lets users confirm investment

---

 WHAT TO DO NEXT:

 1. Structure the actual `execute_investment(...)` function in `wallet_actions.py`:
Build a clear scaffolding function for executing a Raydium LP investment via Solana. Include:

```python
async def execute_investment(wallet_address: str, pool_id: str, amount: float) -> str:
    """
    Executes an LP investment in a Raydium pool.
    Args:
        wallet_address: user's connected Solana wallet
        pool_id: pool identifier (used to fetch pair/token info)
        amount: amount in USDC to invest

    Returns:
        A transaction signature or explorer URL on success, or error string.
    """
    # TODO: 1. Fetch pool metadata from SolPool API (/pools/{id})
    # TODO: 2. Build a Solana transaction using `solana-py` or external TX builder
    # TODO: 3. Send the unsigned transaction to the user's wallet (WalletConnect v2)
    # TODO: 4. Wait for signature or error
    # TODO: 5. Return a link to the transaction (e.g. Solscan)
    return "https://solscan.io/tx/EXAMPLE_SIGNATURE"
Use placeholder functions where needed (e.g. build_lp_transaction(), send_walletconnect_request()), and define TODOs with clarity.
 
2. Prepare for WalletConnect v2 integration:
•	Create a module or function initiate_wallet_connection() that: 
o	Displays a QR code or deeplink (stub for now)
o	Stores a wallet_address to user profile
•	Add placeholder for receiving signed transaction from WalletConnect callback
 
3. Extend database schema (in models.py):
•	Add fields to the User model: 
o	wallet_address
o	wallet_connected_at
o	last_tx_id
•	Add a simple InvestmentLog model (if not yet defined) to store: 
o	user_id
o	pool_id
o	amount
o	tx_hash
o	status
o	created_at
 
4. Update handle_confirm_smart_investment():
•	Validate that the user has a connected wallet
•	Call execute_investment(...) and reply with: 
o	Transaction link if successful
o	Error message if transaction failed or was not signed
 
OUTPUT
Please return:
•	Updated wallet_actions.py with execute_investment() function stubbed but logically structured
•	Updates to models.py to support wallet and investment tracking
•	Edits to smart_invest.py or button_responses.py where execute_investment is invoked
•	Any placeholder files needed for WalletConnect support
With this, FiLot becomes a truly agentic AI investor — not just recommending pools, but enabling users to invest with one tap after connecting their wallet.
